The aim of the study was to uncover the catabolite control proteins A (CcpA) regulon across a list of pathogenic bacteria to identify CcpA DNA binding sites. 
These identified sites were supplemented with experimentally discovered CcpA binding sites, resulting in a robust CcpA-TFBSs dataset. Subsequently, 
this created dataset was used for the building and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN), in order to recognize and predict these binding sites in target pathogenic bacteria.
